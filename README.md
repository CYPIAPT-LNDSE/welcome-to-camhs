# Welcome to CAMHS
A fun and accessible questionnaire for children when first visiting CAMHS. 

This is a fun questionnaire tool that will reduce the anxieties of children (5 - 12 years old) coming to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) for the first time. It offers an alternative questionnaire for children under 12. It fills a gap as there isn't a questionnaire like this. 

This questionnaire helps therapists to get to know a young person better, engaging children and making it an enjoyable experience of filling out questionnaire and more pictorial based appropriate for their developmental stage. 

This web application will be build tablet first as this is the technology most commonly used by the therapists at CAHMS.
