# Welcome to CAMHS
A fun and accessible questionnaire for children when first visiting CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services). 

This questionnaire aims to reduce the anxieties of children (5 - 12 years old) coming to CAMHS for the first time. It offers an alternative questionnaire to the paper based one which is currently used and is not appropriately designed for children. 

CAMHS currently gives the questionnaire to children to complete when they are sitting in the waiting room. Our app intends to replace this often unenjoyable experience with one which provides a positive first interaction with CAMHS, while taking no more time or resources to complete than the paper-based method. 

## Why?

This questionnaire helps therapists get to know a young person better so that they can more quickly build a healthy and meaningful relationship.

## Who?

Welcome to CAMHS is aimed at young people aged 5-12 who are visiting CAMHS and meeting their therapist for the first time. 
Children at the younger end of the age range may need help from staff/parent/guardian to complete some of the questions. 

The therapist and the child will be able to download a PDF of the children's answers when the questionnaire has been completed. This data is stored only in the PDF, the app will not store the private information for longer than the session in which it was created (no database).  

## What? 

We aim to create an engaging web app for children which makes the experience of filling out the questionnaire enjoyable and more pictorial based which is appropriate for their developmental stage. 

This web application will be build tablet first, as this is the technology most commonly used by the therapists at CAMHS.
