# Welcome to CAMHS
A fun and accessible questionnaire for children when first visiting CAMHS. 

This questionnaire aims to reduce the anxieties of children (5 - 12 years old) coming to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) for the first time. It offers an alternative questionnaire to the paperbased one which is currently used and is not appropriately designed for children. 

This questionnaire helps therapists get to know a young person better. We aim to create an engaging web app for children which makes the experience of filling out the questionnaire enjoyable and more pictorial based which is appropriate for their developmental stage. 

This web application will be build tablet first, as this is the technology most commonly used by the therapists at CAMHS.
